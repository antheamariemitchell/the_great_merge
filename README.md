    --The Great Merge--

Combining CSVs: Useful Code Attempt 1

Goals for this script:

1. Make a chunk of code that does something useful

2. Be written in such a way so as to be universal, variables rather than exact names so there are minimal changes required by user

3. Count number of controls as an additional bonus at the end

4. Determine if csvs are of the same length, and alphebetize

5. Check for symmetry based on sample name and remove any mismatches, then output a list of what those are is a separate file

6. Combine two CSVs based on sample name and output a separate merged file
